Changes in SecureCRT 7.2.3 (Official) -- April 1, 2014
------------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - Windows: If the Quick Connect dialog was shown at startup and
    dismissed, clicking on the Session Manager button in the toolbar
    caused SecureCRT to crash.
  - If the global value of "Menu Toolbar File V2" specified a templated
    value, such as "${VDS_INSTALL_PATH}, SecureCRT crashed on startup.
  - When sessions were sorted using the option to arrange the tree
    logically, the sessions were not sorted correctly.
  - In the Quick Connect dialog, if options such as "Show quick connect
    on startup" or "Save session" were changed and then the dialog was
    cancelled, the options were saved.
  - If a new color scheme that had the same properties as an existing
    color scheme was created, it was not saved.
  - SSH2: When the /LOCAL parameter was specified on the command line,
    the port forward was not established.
  - SSH2: When the /REMOTE parameter was specified on the command line,
    the remote port forward was not established.
  - Windows: For all dialogs, tooltips were added to buttons without
    text labels in order to provide button information for screen
    readers such as JAWS.
  - Mac: Buttons or keys mapped to the menu functions
    MENU_RECEIVE_ASCII, MENU_SEND_ASCII, or MENU_SEND_BINARY did not
    work.
  - Mac: On 10.9 (Mavericks), the text on button labels and list views
    was not aligned correctly.
  - Mac: On 10.9 (Mavericks), disabled menu items appeared to be
    available instead of being grayed out.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.2.2 (Official) -- March 20, 2014
-------------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - If a folder with the same name as an existing session was created
    in the same location as the session and the session was moved into
    that folder and then moved into the Sessions folder, the session
    was changed to a folder.
  - If the session manager was unpinned and then closed, the area in
    the session where the session manager had been no longer scrolled.
  - The command (chat) window history did not work.
  - The Quick Connect dialog was not displayed at startup when the
    option "Show Quick Connect at startup" was set.
  - Windows 8: SecureCRT crashed when attempting to upload or create a

    and Esc[F for Home and End.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.2.1 (Official) -- January 16, 2014
---------------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - SecureCRT hung when a Python script tried to disconnect a session
    that had the "Close on disconnect" option set.
  - When multiple sessions were selected in the Connect dialog or
    session manager using the SHIFT or CONTROL keys, sessions could
    incorrectly be unselected.
  - Mac: If an incorrect password was saved in the keychain, it was not
    possible to save the correct password when using keyboard
    interactive authentication.

--------------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - Added the ability to specify what port the TFTP server listens on.

Bug fixes:

  - SSH2: SecureCRT could crash if the SecureCRT application was
    closed while connecting to a session that used public-key
    authentication.
  - Mac/Linux: If a session that started the TFTP server was connected
    and a local shell session was connected and disconnected and then
    the first session was disconnected and reconnected, the TFTP server
    could not be started because the port was already in use.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.2 (Beta 5) -- December 5, 2013
-----------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - SecureCRT crashed if a password for a session that displayed an
    authentication banner at logon was changed in the Session Options
    dialog when the session was not connected.
  - The Arguments.Count script property did not return the correct
    number of arguments for logon scripts.

    response packet contained an "N" in the prefix field to indicate
    that prefixing was not supported by the Kermit server.
  - When the session manager was on, if a session that prompted for
    the username was connected, the username was cached when the "Save
    username" check box was unchecked.

  - It was not possible to map CTRL+"+" and CTRL+"-" to be disabled.
  - Windows: An error was reported during a Kermit upload over a
    serial stream if the first packet's data was queued, because only
    6K out of 9K of data was sent.
  - Mac: SecureCRT crashed if the keyboard shortcuts to zoom a session
    were pressed when no sessions were opened.
  - Mac/Linux: Zmodem, Kermit, and binary file transfers over a serial

-----------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - A progress indicator is displayed when personal data is being
    separated or merged.

    Options dialog, were dismissed.
  - Windows: When the session manager was docked and unpinned, if focus
    was moved from the session manager to the session or command window
    using a keyboard accelerator, the session manager was not hidden.

    or ALT+B was pressed, the session manager was shown and then
    immediately hidden.
  - Windows: If the theme was set to something other than "Shaded" and
    the session manager was dragged, the placement icons were not
    displayed.

    the numeric keypad to zoom in or out, a character was sent to the
    active session.

    arrangement was not always saved correctly.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.2 (Beta 1) -- October 8, 2013
----------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - Windows: Added a Session Manager that can be used in place of the
    modal Connect dialog.  The Session Manager can be in a pane in the
    SecureCRT window or can be an undocked modeless dialog.
  - Added a global option to store personal data such as usernames and
    passwords in a location separate from the rest of the session data,
    which allows personal data to be kept private while other
    configuration data is stored on a network drive or on the cloud so
    that it can be used on different systems or shared with colleagues.
  - Windows/Mac: Added the ability to zoom a session (increase or
    decrease the font size) using CTRL+<mousewheel> or CTRL+"+" or
    CTRL+"-". (Windows and Mac only.)
  - Added a script object CommandWindow that provides access to the
    command (chat) window from a script.
  - Added Ymodem support to the FileTransfer script object, which
    allows Ymodem transfers to be scripted.
  - The script function Screen.Send() can be used to send text to the
    screen only by using a new optional parameter.
  - Added the ability to pass arguments to logon scripts.
  - Added a two-digit year log file parameter substitution "%y".

    that prevents SecureCRT from going into graphics mode when Shift
    Out (\016) is received.
  - SSH2: Added support for SHA-2 MAC algorithms.
  - SSH1/SSH2: Added two new session INI-file-options "Use Global Host
    Key Algorithms" and "Host Key Algorithms" that allow the session
    to order and filter the global host key algorithms.  The session
    host key algorithm list must be a subset of the global host key
    algorithm list.
  - Mac/Linux: Added a new session option "Draw lines graphically"
    that improves the appearance of line-drawing characters.

Changes:

  - The "chat window" has been renamed to "command window".
  - The option to open sessions in a tab is on by default.
  - SecureCRT uses the Default session's background color as the
    background color of the application window at startup.

    list after they are successfully transferred.
  - The anti-idle options to send a string or protocol NO-OP can now
    be configured to an interval of less than 10 seconds.
  - The xterm keymap now sends Esc[H and Esc[F for Home and End.
  - Pressing SHIFT+TAB sends "^[[Z" to the session when xterm
    emulation is specified.
  - The user interface reflects that when the global option "Use
    trackable insertion caret" is set, the session option "Cursor
    style" must be set to "Vertical Bar".
  - SSH1/SSH2: Added the session option "Force session channel to
    close on disconnect" to the Session Options dialog.
  - Telnet: Added the option "Server requires bare CR" to the
    Connection/Telnet category in the Session Options dialog.
  - Serial: The default flow control was changed to none.  This only
    affects new installations.

Bug fixes:

  - If a new session was created and the password was saved, the
    password had to be re-entered if the session was connected again
    without disconnecting the original session.
  - If authentication prompts were displayed in the terminal window,
    the Screen.Synchronous property did not work correctly.
  - If a tab was renamed manually, it reverted back to the original 
    name after toggling between tabbed and tiled mode or if the 
    session received an OSC_TITLE sequence from the remote system.
  - The Transfer menu was available during a transfer.
  - The "Send Zmodem" menu item was available on the drag and drop
    transfer menu when a folder was dragged.
  - SSH2: If the host specified for GSSAPI authentication was an IP
    address, SecureCRT hung during kexinit.
  - Windows: The vertical scrollbar in SecureCRT sessions did not
    work with Windows 8 and WindowBlinds.

    scheme and the system colors were changed, the session did not
    reflect the system changes.
  - Mac/Linux: It was not possible to map keys or buttons to script
    recording menu items.
  - Mac/Linux: If a session name included an ampersand character
    ("&"), the ampersand did not appear in the session name in the
    recent session list.

    not being honored.
